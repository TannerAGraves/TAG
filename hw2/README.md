Abstract
This assignment contains an exploration of methods used in signal analysis, specifically, audio processing. 
As frequency analysis is an indispensable tool, we will make extensive use of the Gábor Transform 
to produce the spectrograms necessary for analyzing our signal. 
From there we will be able to filter and then utilize the time-frequency information 
to extract musical information(timbre of an instrument, as well as note pitch, time and duration).

hw2.m uses 2 '.m' files that contains musical information. one where mary hand a little lamb is played 
on piano. Using spectral analysis the aim of the second part of this code is provide a score like 
representation of the music played.
