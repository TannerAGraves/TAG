This assignment presented the task of firstly using image and video analysis to obtain position
data in a series of videos; a paint can has been filmed from a variety of different perspectives under
several scenarios oscillating on an elastic cord. we â€˜re given multiple different camera angles - including
not upringt, one oscillating vertically under ideal conditions, one with added noise in the form of violent
camera movement, another with significant horizontal movement as well as vertical, and lastly one that
has been perturbed horizontally, vertically and rotationaly. Once this data has been obtained we may
begin to analyze it for redundancies using Principal Component Analysis to yield more useful physical
information about the system

hw3.m utilizies a series of files named camA_B.m 
where A is the camera number between 1 and 3  and B is the test number between 1 and 4. 
These files contain a 4-D varibles that give camera data of size (480, 640, 3, N) 
where N is the number of frames in the pirticular video.

The code utilizies several filter functions that were automatically generated by the MATLAB 
Image Processing tool box. 
Spesifically parameters are chosen such that colors mostly unique to the paint can are filtered and then 
the point tracker object is initialized and given coordinates of notable features of the can after 
filtering.
