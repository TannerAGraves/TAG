hw3.m utilizies a series of files named camA_B.m 
where A is the camera number between 1 and 3  and B is the test number between 1 and 4. 
These files contain a 4-D varibles that give camera data of size (480, 640, 3, N) 
where N is the number of frames in the pirticular video.

The code utilizies several filter functions that were automatically generated by the MATLAB 
Image Processing tool box.
