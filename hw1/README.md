This project demonstrates the use of spectral methods, specifically the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), for signal filtering in 3 spatial dimensions. Additionally, by introducing a time dimension, it is demonstrated that the Fourier Transform is not sensitive to position data. Here this is utilized to discern an object across several data sets by use of its ‘frequency signature’. Ultimately, the FFT proves to be an effective tool for filtering.

hw1.m looks for a Testdata.m which contains a 20 by 262144 varible which contains the 3D ultrasound data at 20 different times.
