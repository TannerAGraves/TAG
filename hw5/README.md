This project documents a first exploration of neural networks for image classification. Using the MNIST Fashion dataset, which consists of 50000 28 by 28 images of 10 different categories of clothing items, we will aim to build neural networks both dense and convolutional to classify these images into their respective categories. Additionally, we will explore popular architectures and methods in search of more effective networks.
