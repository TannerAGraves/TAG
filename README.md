Collection of assignments for Amath482:Computational Methods for Data Analysis course.
Taken at the University of Washington Winter of 2020 from instructor Craig Gin.

Preformance in the course was based on 5 projects, each of which done in either MATLAB or Python focusing on a select few skills fundamental to data science.
This repository is split into 5 subdirectories each containing code and supporting files for a piticular assignment:  
  hw1 - Employs the Fast Fourier Transform for noise filtering of 3D data.  
  hw2 - Uses the Gabor Transform to explore sprectrograms and produces musical scores for audio recordings  
  hw3 -
